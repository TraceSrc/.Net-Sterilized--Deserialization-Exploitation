# .Net-Sterilized--Deserialization-Exploitation

As researched by   James Forshaw, this is a tool which uses python c# wrapper to exploit different .net sterilization vulnerabilities. James really done very good research on this.
On my weekend research, I wrote this tool to help security researcher, red teamer to verify the .net sterilization vulnerabilities.
